                    <p>
                        Hello everyone! My name is Eric Tong. I graduated from Carnegie Mellon University in
                        2022 with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. 15-259 Probability and Computing,
                        15-410 Operating Systems, and 15-440 Distributed Systems are some of the classes I took during my time there.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Since February 2023, I've been working as a software engineer in New York.
                        The programming languages I'm most familiar with are OCaml and C.
                    <!-- <p>
                        I was a Teaching Assistant for CMU's 15-210 Parallel and Sequential Data Structures and Algorithms class 
                        for three semesters. Drawing from experience competing in the USA Computing Olympiad, I've also mentored students both one-and-one and in a classroom environment,
                        teaching algorithmic concepts and problem-solving techniques.
