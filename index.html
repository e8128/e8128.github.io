                    <p>
                        Hello everyone! My name is Eric Tong, and I'm a junior majoring in Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon.
                        I'm currently looking for an Summer 2022 software engineering internship.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        I've worked with Python, Java, C/C++, and Go. I have experience in research, personal projects, and software engineering internships.
                        This summer, I've been working on a research project in complexity theory at CMU funded by the Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship program.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Besides Computer Science, I'm interested in teaching. I've been a Teaching Assistant for CMU's 15-210 Parallel and Sequential Data Structures and Algorithms class 
                        for two semesters. Drawing from my own experience competing in the USA computing Olympiad, I've also mentored students both one-and-one and in a classroom environment,
                        teaching them algorithmic concepts and problem-solving techniques.
                    </p>
